<span style="font-weight: bold;">When a WireTapping attempt is Detected, this App tries to Identify the App Responsible for the Attack/Event.<br>
<br>
In most cases, it gets it right.<br>
<br>
However, there may be cases where "WireTap Removal" can make an error.<br>
<br>
In some cases a Responsible App simply cannot be found, in some other few cases </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"WireTap Removal" </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">will blame another App than the Guilty one.<br>
<br>
This is particularly true for Apps which make Hidden Calls - which may
be hard to Detect - e.g. because they are often active some time before
the actual Hidden Call is taking place.<br>
<br>
The Main Purpose of this App is to Detect WireTapping Attempts and Identify the Apps Responsible.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">
So; you should be particularly careful before UNINSTALLing an App -
before you are quite sure that it is the Correct App you want to get
rid of.</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The Identification of Apps will get <span style="font-style: italic;">more accurate and reliable</span> after you have <a href="#WHITELISTING">Whitelisted</a> most of your own Apps - those Apps that you often use.<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Once you have Whitelisted all of your Innocent Apps that generate a Warning, please <a href="#SKIPPING_WHITELISTED_APPS_IN_APPS">Read This</a>.<br>

</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="MICROPHONE_RECORDINGS"></a>RECORDINGS</span></h3>


<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h3>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">There may exist a Spy App on your Phone which makes Recordings by using the Microphone or the Camera of your Device.<br>
<br>
The purpose is to listen in on you.<br>
<br>
Such a method will also record VoIP Calls, such as made by Skype, etc.<br>
<br>
Each Recording is saved in a file, which may be sent (e.g. via Email) to some unknown receiver.<br>
<br>
If the Microphone is used - or a Video Recording is being made - on your Device, "WireTap Removal" will detect it.<br>
<br>
This also means that - if you are going to<a href="#BEFORE_MAKING_A_RECORDING_-_OR_A_VOIP"> use the Microphone yourself</a>, you should first Disable </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"WireTap Removal" - to avoid a Warning.</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Please note that it is only possible to detect a&nbsp; Recording
at <a href="#CHECKING_PERIOD">Regular Intervals</a> - as set by you (on the Settings Page).<br>
<br>
A short Checking Period will increase the chances of detecting brief Recordings, but will increase <a href="#HOW_TO_MINIMIZE_BATTERY_CONSUMPTION">Battery Consumption</a> slightly.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
</span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="#WireTap_Detection_FAQs">BACK TO TOP</a><br>

<br>

<h3><a name="BEFORE_MAKING_A_RECORDING_-_OR_A_VOIP"></a>BEFORE MAKING A RECORDING - OR A VoIP CALL - YOU SHOULD DISABLE THIS APP<br>
</h3>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Before you are making one of the following, you may want to DISABLE "WireTap Removal":<br>
<br>
- A Voice/Audio Recording,<br>
- A Video Recording,<br>
- A Skype Call,<br>
- A VoIP Call, etc.<br>
</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">All of these use the Microphone of your Device, which will be detected by "WireTap Removal" as a Recording.<br>
<br>
If you do NOT disable "WireTap Removal", your Recording/VoIP Call will
be registered by two Log entries; One when you Started the Recording/Call,
and&nbsp; a Second when it was ended (at the times when the Mic Checking was done, as
specified by you).<br>
<br><span style="font-style: italic;">An even better Alternative</span> - when this App detects that you start the Recording/Call - is to <a href="#WHITELISTING">WHITELIST</a> the app.<br>
<br>
Then it should not be detected the next time you are using it.<br>
<br>
(Normal Phone Calls do NOT use the normal Microphone of your Device, so
you do not have to Disable this App before making Normal Phone Calls.)<br>
</span><br>

<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="#WireTap_Detection_FAQs">BACK TO TOP</a><br>

<br>

<h3><a name="FALSE_DETECTION_OF_MICROPHONE"></a>FALSE DETECTION OF RECORDINGS?</h3>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">False Detection of Recordings should NEVER occur on Android 5 and older.<br>
<br>
On Android 6, False Detection of Recordings may occur.<br>
<br>
If you see a Call Recording or a Microphone Recording being Detected, it is very likely caused by a REAL Recording.<br>
<br>
Either done by a Spy App, by yourself (running your own Recording App), or by <a href="#A_MICROPHONE_RECORDING_IS_ALWAYS_BEING"><span style="font-style: italic;">Another App</span> using the Microphone</a>.<br>
<br>
On Android 6, If you get a Warning about a Recording by an app that you know, you should Whitelist it.<br>
</span><br>

<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="#WireTap_Detection_FAQs">BACK TO TOP</a><br>
<br>
<h3><a name="CHECKING_PERIOD"></a>CHECKING PERIOD</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Checking of Recordings is only made at Regular Intervals - selected by you (on the Settings page) - e.g. once per minute.<br>
<br>
If a Recording App is running in a shorter time than the selected Check Period/Interval, it <span style="font-style: italic;">cannot</span> be detected.<br>
<br>
Also - when you are testing to check whether this App will Detect your Recording - you must also <span style="font-style: italic;">Stop</span> for long enough to make this App Register that the recording has in fact <span style="font-style: italic;">Stopped</span>, before it will Detect a <span style="font-style: italic;">New</span> Recording.<br>
<br>
Setting a very low Check Period will increase the <a href="#HOW_TO_MINIMIZE_BATTERY_CONSUMPTION">Battery Consumption</a>.<br>
<br>
Another reason for Not Detecting a Recording, is that the App that was doing it, has been <a href="#WHITELISTING">Whitelisted</a> by you. E.g. if the "Google Play Services" has been Whitelisted, Recordings that are done by <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> App - or other Apps that is <span style="font-style: italic;">using</span> the </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Google Play Services" <span style="font-style: italic;">to do Recordings</span> for them - the Recording will Not be Registered.<br>
<br>
If you want to be able to detect your manually started Recordings better/quicker, you should <span style="font-style: italic;">reduce</span> the Checking Period. But please note that this will increase Battery Consumption.<br>
<br>
If you agree that the Main Purpose of this App is to Detect <span style="font-style: italic;">other</span> than your own (i.e. possibly Spy) Apps, you should be able to live with a relatively long Checking Period.<br>

<h3><a name="LOCATION"></a>LOCATION</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">When an App Reads your Location, "WireTap Removal" will detect it.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If you are particularly interested in
detecting most of the Apps that do Read your Location, you should
select a very short Check Period.<br>
<br>
See more details <a href="#IDENTIFYING_APPS_THAT_READ_YOUR_LOCATION">here</a>.<br>
</span>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A short Check Period should not be used over a long time, as it will increase the <a href="#HOW_TO_MINIMIZE_BATTERY_CONSUMPTION">Battery Consumption</a>.</span><br>
<br>

<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="#WireTap_Detection_FAQs">BACK TO TOP</a><br>
<br>
<h3><a name="A_LOT_OF_APPS_READ_YOUR_LOCATION"></a>A LOT OF APPS READ YOUR LOCATION!</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">As you may have detected, there is a surprisingly large lot of Apps on your Device that reads your Location.<br>
<br>
Why do they do it? We don't know.<br>
<br>
This is undesirable, but Normal.<br>
<br>
There is not much you can do about it.<br>
<br>
(You may of course turn off Location by GPS and/or Network on your
Device, but as the Location is often required in other contexts, this
is not practical.) <br>
<br>
You can <a href="#THE_WARNING_SCREEN">UNINSTALL</a> some of those Apps that do it - which you don't know or don't need - or which you don't like anyway.<br>
<br>
Otherwise - in order to reduce the number of Warnings, you should <a href="#WHITELISTING">Whitelist</a> most of them.<br>
<br>
And to reduce the number of Events being logged, you should Disable Logging of Whitelisted Events (on the Settings page). <br>
<br>
Please see more details <a href="#I_AM_BEING_WARNED_ALL_THE_TIME_-_BY_APPS">here</a> and <a href="#IDENTIFYING_APPS_THAT_READ_YOUR_LOCATION">here</a>.<br>

<h3><a name="I_AM_BEING_WARNED_ALL_THE_TIME_-_BY_APPS"></a>I AM BEING WARNED ALL THE TIME - BY APPS THAT READ MY LOCATION. WHAT SHALL I DO?<br>
</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In order to avoid being disturbed
continuously by Warning about Apps that read your Location, you can
select one or more of the following options:<br>
<br>
On the Settings Page:<br>
<br>
1) Disable "WireTap Removal", or<br>
2) Disable the Detection of  Apps Reading your (GPS or rework) Location, or<br>
3) Turn off the Audible Warning Sound, and/or<br>
4) Turn off the (Red) Visible Warning Screen, or<br>
5) Whitelist each App as it is Detected, or<br>
6) Uninstall the Detected Apps which you think may&nbsp; be a threat<br>
<br>
Disabling "WireTap Removal" (1) may <span style="font-style: italic;">always</span>
be a good Option when you are using your own Device for Recording
Voice or Video, making VoIP Calls (Skype, WiFi Calls, etc), to avoid
being Warned again and again - and to stop the Log being filled up.<br>
<br>
The only way to stop the Log filling up, are Alternatives 1 and 2. But remember to <span style="font-style: italic;">reEnable</span> them again when you want to start Detecting Real WireTapping Events.<br>
<br>
Alternative 3 may be the best if you are <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> using your Device for a particular purpose.<br>
<br>
Alternatives 2 <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> 3 may be the best if you <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> using your Device.<br>
<br>
Whitelisting (5) is also a good Alternative, but then you should
Disable Logging of Whitelisted Apps - in order to avoid the Log being
filled up.<br>
<br>
You should only Uninstall (6) an app after having made sure that it really <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> a Spy App.</span><br>

<br>
<h3><a name="IDENTIFYING_APPS_THAT_READ_YOUR_LOCATION"></a>IDENTIFYING APPS THAT READ YOUR LOCATION</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Identifying Apps that read your Location is a rather tricky matter (for this App).<br>
<br>
Facts:<br>
<br>
1. Some Apps that read your Location only run for a <span style="font-style: italic;">very short</span> time.<br>
<br>
2. Other Apps that read your Location run almost continuously - hidden in the background - but they <span style="font-style: italic;">never stop or start.</span> They just keep on running, </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> occasionally </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">reading your Location.<br>
<br>
3. When you are running one of your own Apps which reads the Location
(e.g. such as a GPS Tester, a Map or Navigational App, a Speedometer,
etc.), they may read the Location very often, and more or less set up a
"Screen" or "Shield" - through which other Location Reading apps can hardly
penetrate.<br>
<br>
Hence; In order to be able to <span style="font-style: italic;">catch - and identify</span> an App that is reading you Location - you should:<br>
<br>
- Set up a very Short Checking Period (on the Settings page) (But
please note that you should not continue doing this for a long time, as
it will increase the battery consumption considerably.)<br>
<br>
- Avoid using Location Reading Apps of your own (e.g. such as </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS Testers, Map or Navigational Apps, Speedometers, etc.).</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
In short: <span style="font-style: italic;">When</span> you are running one of your Own Location Reading Apps, you
should not expect to be able to catch and Identify a Real WireTapping
Location Reading App - so you may as well DISABLE this App.</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">There may exist a Spy App on your Phone that records every Phone Call you make.<br>
<br>
Each Recording is saved in a file, which may be sent (e.g. via Email) to some unknown receiver.<br>
<br>
If a Phone Call is being recorded, "WireTap Removal" will detect it.<br>

If Call Recordings are registered on your Phone (and they are not caused
by your own recordings!), you should UNINSTALL the App causing the trouble - to remove it from your

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="HIDDEN_CALLS"></a>HIDDEN CALLS</span></h3>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hidden Phone Calls may be set up (i.e. connected) controlled remotely from another Device, but done by a Spy App on your Phone.<br>
The purpose is to listen in on you - without you noticing or hearing it.<br>
<br>
There are two types of Hidden Calls; Outgoing and Incoming.<br>
<br>
An Outgoing Hidden Call is made from your Phone, by (an App) calling another number. <br>
<br>
An Incoming Hidden Call is made from another phone, making a Call to
your Phone, but after the Ringer has been set to Silent on your Phone
(by a Spy App).<br>
<br>
Both Outgoing and Incoming Hidden Calls are silent (so that you will
not hear anything), but the usual Call Screen is normally shown.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If Hidden Calls are registered on
your Phone, you
may also want to consult our free app "Anti Spy" - and compare the <a href="#ANALYSIS_OF_WIRETAPPING_APPS">Responsible App <span style="font-style: italic;">suggested</span></a>
by "WireTap Removal" by those listed by "Anti Spy" in order to find the
Spy App which seems to be causing the trouble - and remove it from your
Device.<br>

When a Whitelisted App is detected, a Warning will NOT be Shown/Heard.
The Event may be logged, however, if you have enabled the optional

<h3><a name="FALSE_DETECTION_OF_HIDDEN_CALLS"></a>FALSE DETECTION OF HIDDEN CALLS</h3>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Some of your normal Phone Calls may be registered as Hidden Calls. We call them False Detections.<br>
<br>
Due to hardware and software differences on various Android Devices,
you may need to adjust the "Hidden Call Detection Sensibility" Factor
(on the Settings page) - in order to reduce the number of False Detections.<br>
<br>
Reduce the </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Hidden Call Detection Sensibility" to the LOWEST setting, and check if you still get some False Detections of Hidden Calls.<br>
<br>
If you do NOT, </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">try to increase it a step or two. If you experience some False
Detections of Hidden Calls (i.e. some of you own Calls being detected
as Hidden), you should decrease it again. <br>
<br>
If you still get some False Detection of Hidden Calls, you should try to <span style="font-style: italic;">take it a little more easy</span> when selecting Phone Numbers from your List of Contacts.<br>
<br>
In order to keep a high
degree of Hidden Calls Detection, you may want to accept a few False
Detections now and then.<br>

<h3><a name="WIRETAP_DETECTION_is_NOT_a_Spy_App"></a>"WIRETAP REMOVAL" is NOT a Spy App!</h3>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">An AntiSpy App lists this App as being a "Suspicious App".<br>
<br>
Based on the Permissions this App needs, it says that "WireTap Removal":<br>
<br>
"Can Read your Location",<br>
"Records Audio on Voice Calls", <br>
"Handles Outgoing Calls",<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">
"Runs on device startup".</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Except for Starting at Startup, this App does not do any of these things - even if it has the permissions to do so.<br>
<br>
As shown on its Description on the Google Play Store, this App needs the following Permissions:<br>
<br>
ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION,<br>
ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION,<br>
RECORD_AUDIO,<br>
PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS (sometimes called REROUTING_OUTGOING_CALLS), <br>
plus a few others of less interest in this connection.<br>
<br>
The </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION and </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
Permissions are needed in order to check whether ANOTHER App is Reading
your Location, using the GPS or NETWORK, respectively.</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
The RECORD_AUDIO Permission is used by this App to check if some other
App is using the Microphone. It NEVER makes any Recording.<br>
<br>
The PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS Permission is used by this App to receive a
notification each time there is an Outgoing Phone Call, and to get the Outgoing Call Phone Number. It NEVER
"processes" the Call, or affects it in any way.<br>
<br>
Hence; "WireTap Removal" is NOT A SPY APP. On the contrary, it tries to DETECT when you are being spied on!<br>

We have had reports that this App interacts with a few other apps in undesirable ways. Both <a href="#A_MICROPHONE_RECORDING_IS_ALWAYS_BEING">with a few Mic-Blocking Apps</a>, and with other Anti-WireTapping Apps, such as "MoTel".<br>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="A_MICROPHONE_RECORDING_IS_ALWAYS_BEING"></a>A MICROPHONE RECORDING IS ALWAYS BEING DETECTED</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If a Microphone and/or Call Recording
always seem to be detected on your Device, there is either an actual
Recording going on, OR some other App has occupied ("taken over") the
Microphone. A few "Microphone Blocking" Apps do that. </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">E.g.
"Mic Block (Anti spy &amp; malware)" by BytePioneers (Also called
"Microphone Block Free, com.bettertomorrowapps. microphoneblockfree) and "Spy Mic Bodyguard" (by DieselByte).</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The simplest way to solve this issue is to swap the </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Microphone Blocking" App you are currently using with another </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Microphone
Blocking" App which only MUTES the Microphone (but does not engage the
recorder). That should also result in less <a href="#HOW_TO_MINIMIZE_BATTERY_CONSUMPTION">Battery Consumption</a>.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">OR you can disable both the
Detection of Call Recordings and Microphone Recordings (on the Settings
Page) - but then you might as well forget the entire "WireTap Removal" App.<br>
<br>
If you do not seem to have a </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Microphone Blocking" App on your Device which can explain the "continuous Recording", the Microphone may be <span style="font-style: italic;">stuck</span> (due to a fault on your Device). One way to solve this problem is to RESTART your Device.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Please also note that you should only have <a href="#YOU_SHOULD_ONLY_HAVE_ONE_ANTI"><span style="font-style: italic;">one</span> Anti WireTapping App running</a>, as they may affect each other in undesirable ways.</span><br>

<br>
If you have two <span style="font-style: italic;">similar</span> Apps running at the same time, they may affect each other in undesirable ways.<br>
<br>
When this App wants to check if another App is using the Microphone, it
will itself try to engage the Microphone for a very short period of
time.<br>
<br>
If another similar App is doing the same, they will eventually detect each other, and Warn about a Recording!<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">So, if you have strange Warnings about Recordings, make sure that only ONE Anti-Wiretapping-like App is running. This one!</span><br>

<h3><a name="MANY_ANTIVIRUS__SECURITY_APPS_ARE"></a>MANY "ANTIVIRUS &amp; SECURITY" APPS ARE READING YOUR LOCATION</h3>

<h3><a name="SKIPPING_WHITELISTED_APPS_IN_APPS"></a>SKIPPING WHITELISTED APPS IN APPS ANALYZES</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In the normal analysis of Apps which
are considered (to be Responsible for a possible WireTap Attack), all relevant Apps are</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">taken
into consideration. And the most likely app is picked. Even if it is a
Whitelisted App.&nbsp; (But if it is a Whitelisted App, it will - of
course - not generate a Warning.)<br>
<br>
After you have used this App for a while, you will probably have
Whitelisted all of the Apps that you normally use. So that you should no
longer be bothered by the Red Warning Screen.<br>
<br>
Now you are probably only interested in getting Warnings on REAL WireTapping Attempts.<br>
<br>
In order to better achieve this goal, we have introduced a Setting that will <span style="font-style: italic;">Change</span> the Analysis Algorithms.<br>
<br>
By enabling "Skip Whitelisted Apps in Analyzes" (on the Settings page),
the Analysis Algorithms of Apps will try to SKIP (Ignore) Whitelisted
Apps, in order to better Concentrate on the Non-Whitelisted Apps.
During this Process, a Whitelisted App which may be the most
likely App to be picked, will be Ignored, while the other
(Non-Whitelisted Apps) will be Analyzed in more depth.<br>
<br>
(But if the Whitelisted App is the <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> possible Culprit found, IT will still be picked - but giving no Warning.)<br>
<br>
A negative side-effect of this method is that some Innocent App may be
Identified as Responsible for a WireTapping Attempt (e.g. while the
Real Culprit was one of the Whitelisted Apps.). However, as you should
have Whitelisted all of your Apps that can cause a Warning by now, this
should not happen often.<br>
<br>
A positive effect of this method is to Detect ANY NEW App that can WireTap your Device.<br>
<br>
It will also increase the likelihood of Identifying Spy Apps that are well hidden, and/or designed to avoid Detection.<br>
<br>
You should NOT Enable this Setting before you consider yourself <span style="font-style: italic;">finished</span> with Whitelisting all of your own (Innocent) Apps which can cause a Warning.</span><br>

System has to Stop several Apps, even those that have a High Priority,
like this App.<br>
<br>
When this happens, this App may no longer function properly. In particular, the Detection of Hidden Calls may Fail.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">You can optionally Enable (or Disable) "Automatic Disable Detection of Hidden Calls at Overload" at the Settings page.<br>

If this Option is Enabled, the Detection of Hidden Calls will

this is to avoid further False Detections of Hidden Calls. If you want
to continue Detection of Hidden Calls even if System Overloads occurs
on your Device, you should Disable this Setting.<br>
<br>
If the Detection of Hidden Calls has been Automatically Disabled in
this way, you must manually reEnable it - if you want to continue
Detecting Hidden Calls.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

help temporarily.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What shall I do?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If it is an App that you <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">use</span>, you should <a href="#WHITELISTING">WHITELIST</a> it.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Or - if you are using Android 6 or later - AND the App in question has been <span style="font-style: italic;">targeted</span> (i.e. made for) Android 6 - you can try to Disable its Permission to use the Microphone.<br>
<br>
(This will normally <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> work with earlier Android versions - or earlier App versions.)<br>
<br>
(If the App has <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> been targeted for Android 6, you will be warned that it may not work when/if you try to modify its Permissions.)<br>
<br>
If you don't use or know the App, you should <span style="font-style: italic;">Uninstall</span> it.<br>

<h3><a name="ABOUT_RUNTIME_PERMISSIONS"></a>ABOUT RUNTIME PERMISSIONS</h3>


For Android 6 and later, the User must <span style="font-style: italic;">grant</span> certain "dangerous" Permissions for an App.<br>


<br>


For this App, these are Permissions to RECORD_AUDIO, READ_PHONE_STATE and ACCESS_LOCATION..<br>


<br>


The first is required in order to be able to check the Microphone of your
Device - if it is being used or not.<br>


<br>

The second is required to be able to get Information about the Phone
State - e.g. when it is in a Call State, read the Phone Number you are
Calling, etc<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>.<br>
<br>
The third is required in order to be able to read the Location of your Device.<br>


<br>


The app will only work if you Grant all of these Permissions.<br>


<br>


If you do not want to Grant these Permissions, the App cannot enter the Enabled state, and thus is useless.<br>


<br>


Permissions for an App can also be granted - or rejected - from the Device's Settings App.<br>


<br>


If you reject a Permission in that way - that you have previously granted - the app may misbehave, or stop.<br>


<br>


In order to get it working properly again, you must Restart and/or Disable it. It will then ask for that Permission again.<br>


<br>


If you have clicked on the Option to 'Never ask again' - the Request for Permissions will <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> be shown again.<br>


<br>


If you <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> want to have it shown again - after all - you must uninstall the app, and reinstall it.<br>

<br>

If you wonder why the App needs these Permissions, please read <a href="#WIRETAP_DETECTION_is_NOT_a_Spy_App">this</a>.<br>

<h3><a name="USERS_OF_ANDROID_8_and_Later_-_PLEASE"></a>USERS OF ANDROID 8 (and Later) - PLEASE NOTE:</h3>
From Android 8, Google has modified the APIs of the Android Operating
Systems - probably to increase its safety and your security.<br>
<br>
This has lead to various restrictions, e.g. as to how an App (like this one) can find out what Services that are running.<br>
<br>
This again has introduced some limitations in our App. E.g. such as reducing the <span style="font-style: italic;">accuracy</span> of&nbsp; finding out What App is attempting to Spy on you.<br>
<br>
This means that when a WireTapping Attempt is detected, it is harder (for this App) to find out WHAT App is actually doing it.<br>
<br>
So - If you are using Android 8 (or later) - <span style="font-weight: bold;">to start with</span> - just after you have installed this App - and it detects e.g. a Mic Recording - the chances of Detecting the <span style="font-style: italic;">actual</span> Culprit will be a little reduced. Our App <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> find the Real Guilty App, or it may pick on another one (which <span style="font-style: italic;">could</span> have been making the recording).<br>
<br>
Then it is important that you WHITELIST all the Apps that you are Warned about - that you know and use.<br>
<br>
After a whille - when you have Whitelisted all of your known Apps, <span style="font-style: italic;">then</span> other Apps that try to WireTap your Device, will be <span style="font-weight: bold;">correctly</span> Identified,<br>

<br>
<h3><a name="Why_are_Phone_Numbers_shown_as_Unknown"></a>Why are Phone Numbers shown as Unknown? </h3>
Depending on which version of the App you are using - and from which
App Store you downloaded it - Phone Numbers shown in the Log may be
shown as "Unknown".<br>
<br>
This is done in order to comply with Google's new strict App Permissions Policy.<br>
<br>
Normal Apps downloaded from The Google Play store are no longer allowed
to read and register the Phone Numbers being Called to or From.<br>
<br>
If it is important to you to get/see the actual Phone numbers being
called to or from, please send us an email. skibapps@gmail.com.<br>

<br>
<h3><a name="WHAT_DOES_DNSTA_STAND_FOR"></a>WHAT DOES "DNSTA" STAND FOR?</h3>

"DNSTA" stands for "Do Not Show This Again". It is used in some Dialogs.<br>

<br>

When you tap on a Button with this Text, the Dialog will NOT be shown again. <br>

<br>

If you have removed some particular Dialog in this Way, and you want to
have it back, you must Uninstall the App, and Reinstall it.<br>

<br>

(When you Uninstall an App, and Reinstall it, all of your Data - i.e. Settings, Logs, etc. will be lost.) <br>
