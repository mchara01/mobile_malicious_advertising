<p>This Privacy Policy (&#8220;Policy&#8221;) applies to your use of all of our Applications ("Apps") on all platforms.<br>
</p>

<p>Skibapps ( &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221;) has created this Policy to explain 
our privacy practices and what information about you is collected, used 
and disclosed with respect to the Applications, the Services and the 
Site.</p>

<p>This Policy covers our collection, use and disclosure of your 
information through the Applications, the Services and the Site. It does
 not cover any collection, use or disclosure by third parties through 
any applications, Web sites, products or services that we do not control
 or own. All trademarks, trade names, and logos used on the web site or 
at the applications belong to their respective owners.</p>

<p><strong>I. COLLECTION, USE and DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.</strong></p>
<p>Our Apps <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">do not collect any Information</span> from your Device, neither Personal Information, nor any Non-Personal Information or Usage Data, nor any Logs.</p>
<p>(An exception is our App "Cell Spy Catcher" - which will optionally
send Non-Personal Data about the Detected Networks to an External
Database - if you allow it.)<br>
</p>
Since <span style="font-style: italic;">we</span> do not collect any such Information, we do not use it, and cannot disclose it.<br>
<p><strong>II. THIRD- PARTY LINKS WITHIN THE APP OR SITE</strong></p>

<p>Since our apps are distributed through third party sites &#8211; Google Play Store, 
etc., we may provide links to them
 in our Apps. The Site may also carry advertisements
 from other companies. <strong>Our apps do carry third-party Advertisements and/or Third Party Advertising SDKs</strong>.
 We do not collect your information on and through and This Policy does 
not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy practices of 
Web sites operated by third parties linked to our web site.</p>

<p><strong>III. SENSITIVE INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>We never ask you to send us, or disclose, any sensitive Personal 
Information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, 
political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, sexual 
orientation, criminal background or membership in past organizations, 
including trade union memberships) on or through an Application, the 
Services or the Site or otherwise to us.</p>

<p><strong>IV. SECURITY</strong></p>

<p>We are very concerned about the confidentiality of
 your information. Since we don&#8217;t collect any personal (or other) information, we 
also don&#8217;t store any personal or non-personal information on our 
servers. On top of that, we take all reasonable measures to protect the 
non-personal information collected in third party Google Analytics 
service from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. However, no 
method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing 
information is completely secure.</p>

 on a regular basis to keep yourself apprised of any changes. If you do 
not agree to any modifications to this Policy, your sole recourse is to

following the posting of any modifications to this Policy will 
constitute your acceptance of the revised Policy.</p>
